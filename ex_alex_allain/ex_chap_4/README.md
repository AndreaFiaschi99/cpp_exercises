Chapter 4

If statements

Practice problems 
1. Ask for two users' ages, and indicate who is older; behave differently if both are over 100

2. Implement a simple "password" system that takes a password in the form of a number. Make it so that either of two numbers is valid, but use only one if statment to do the check

3. Write a small calculator that takes as input one of the four arithmetic operations, the two arguments to those operations, and then prints out the result.

4. Expand the pasword checking program from earlier in this chapter and make it take multiple usernames, each with their own password, and ensure that the right username is used for the right password. Provide the ability to prompt users afain if the first login attempt failed. Think about how easy (or hard) it is to do this for a lot of usernames and passwords.
