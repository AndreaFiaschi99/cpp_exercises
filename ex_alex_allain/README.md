Exercises used to get familiar with C++ programming. 
They are taken from the book "Jumping into C++" written by Alex Allein, creator of cprogramming.com. 

If you want to run one of the exercises in this folder it is necessary to compile them to generate the executable and then run the generated executable. You can do this in two ways:
    1) If you just want to test the exercise without pushing anything in the repository then once you are inside the directory of ex_i, type in the linux terminal "g++ ex_i.cpp -o x_i" to generate the executable. To then run it type "./ex_i"
    2) If you are planning (and have the authorization) to work on existing exercise or add new ones you need to compile the exercise inside a build directory, so that it will be ignored when you push any contribution. Once you are inside the directory of ex_i, type in the linux terminal "mkdir build" to create the repository called build and then "g++ ex_i.cpp -o build/ex_i" to generate the executable. To then run it type "build/ex_1" or go into the build directory "cd build" and then run the executable with "./ex_i"

Here is a list of all the exercises present in this directory:
    - ex_1: print helloworld
    - ex_2: showcase input and output and differences between integer and floating point operations
    - ex_chap_3: showcases how the input / output works, basic operations between numbers, difference between input output.
    - ex_chap_4:
    - ex_chap_5:
